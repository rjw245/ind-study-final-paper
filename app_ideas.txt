1. iPhone encryption side-channel attack
    - Info: http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/03/03/technology/apple-iphone-fbi-fight-explained.html?_r=0
    - With the recent conflict between Apple and the FBI over encryption on the
      iPhone, there will be heightened interest in the security of mobile
      phones.
    - Perhaps a side-channel attack is possible, such as measuring
      the temperature of the section of the chip dedicated to
      encryption/decryption. But what would they look for?
    - Does the length of time AES encryption is running (or some other
      encryption) tell you information you wouldn't otherwise have about the
      correctness of your key? i.e. How close it is to the right key?
    - Well, how does AES work?

    - On second thought, this might not be the best application for Dave's work.
      Thermal side-channel attacks are best for determining if hardware is on or
      off over long time scales. It would not be feasible to use temperature to
      measure if an AES engine runs 1ms longer.

~~~~~ Many-Acc. Memories ~~~~~
This project is interested in the interactions between many accelerators. I
should design an application that combines accelerators in a variety of
datapaths to effectively evaluate Dave's memory infrastructure. This design
needs to be more explicit than the security application. I need to describe in
detail how data flows from one accelerator to another, and at what granularity.
I should also think about how many accelerators there are in the system and how
they might need to be shared among multiple threads, as this could be an
interesting hurdle for Dave's system.

1. Web server workload acceleration
    - A web server that uses hardware acceleration would have to share
      accelerators as resources between many parallel threads trying to serve
      clients data.
    - Posssible Accelerators:
        - SSL accelerator, (and other encryption)
        - Database accelerator? Probably not feasible, needs to access a disk so
          it's limited by the speed of the storage
        - Accelerators should be able to talk directly to the network interface
