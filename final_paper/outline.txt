Outline:
The Need for Multi-Accelerator Applications in the Evaluation of
Accelerator-Rich Architectures

Intro Summary: The power constraints of today's computers will force architects to
integrate specialized accelerators on chip in large numbers. This shift demands
new architectures that can coordinate hundreds and even thousands of these
specialized blocks. To convincingly evaluate these experimental architectures,
researchers will need a catalog of accelerator-rich applications.

Thesis: Researchers will need to test their work with accelerator-rich
applications so that they can fully explore the interactions that occur in
accelerator-rich systems. To this end, I have begun development of an
accelerator-rich application for use in Dr. Mark Hempstead's computer
architecture lab at Tufts University.

I.   The Motivation for Specialization
II.  Challenges of an Accelerator Rich Architecture (what sorts of issues arise
from accelerators that need to be solved by the architecture?)
    A. Streaming to avoid a bottleneck imposed by the CPU.
    B. Wasted area on unused memory (must share it)
    C. Sharing accelerators between parallel threads
    D. How to expose the accelerator to software
III. The Value of Accelerator-Rich Applications for Evaluating Architectures
    A. Examples of applications that I have read about:
        1. Mention the robotic bee (any insight it has provided on architecture
        design?)
        2. The application from the Accelerator Store
            i. Discuss how they used the application to validate their design,
            and how validation was possible because it used many accelerators.
        3. AXR-CMP: Architecture Support in Accelerator-Rich CMPs tests with
        applications that use several accelerators.
IV. Requirements of an Accelerator-Rich Application and Its Underlying Testbed
Architecture
    A. Must Be Scalable to Hundreds of Accelerators
    B. Must provide a generic interface that can be fitted to any accelerator IP.
    C. Must allow for accelerator streaming

I. Background information
    A. Motivation for Specialized Architectures
        1. 
    B. Motivation for Multi-Accelerated Apps

II. My design - briefly introduce the application, then move to architecture, then
fully describe the software.
    A. Accelerator Architecture in Vivado
        1. Describe the accelerators
        2. Describe the interconnection with the Zynq processor.
            a. Design decision such as:
                i.   Interface? AXI. Why?
                ii.  Sharing memory between accelerator and processor. How?
                iii. 
    B. Software written in Xilinx SDK
        1. What does it do?
        2. What path does data take between the accelerator and processor
        blocks?
