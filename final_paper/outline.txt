Outline:
The Need for Multi-Accelerator Applications in the Evaluation of
Accelerator-Rich Architectures

I. Background information
    A. Motivation for Specialized Architectures
        1. 
    B. Motivation for Multi-Accelerated Apps

II. My design - briefly introduce the application, then move to architecture, then
fully describe the software.
    A. Accelerator Architecture in Vivado
        1. Describe the accelerators
        2. Describe the interconnection with the Zynq processor.
            a. Design decision such as:
                i.   Interface? AXI. Why?
                ii.  Sharing memory between accelerator and processor. How?
                iii. 
    B. Software written in Xilinx SDK
        1. What does it do?
        2. What path does data take between the accelerator and processor
        blocks?
