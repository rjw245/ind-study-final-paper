\section{Project Execution Evaluation}
My original task was to develop an application that uses many accelerators in a way that highlights their varied interactions in a many-accelerator architecture. Along the way, I discovered that designing the underlying architecture itself would take a significant amount of time. Decisions needed to be made about how data would be moved between accelerators, what interface accelerators would need to comply with. To make these decisions and implement them, I needed to learn a number of programs---such as the Xilinx SDK, Vivado, and Vivado HLS---and also research hardware accelerators, accelerator-rich architectures, and general principles for architectural-level design.

Ultimately, I was unable to begin work on the application itself, but I have accomplished an important piece of this project in developing and validating the underlying architecture. To date, I have validated the current architecture design, highlighted areas for improvement and further development, and packaged the architecture so that someone else can easily pick up where I left off.
